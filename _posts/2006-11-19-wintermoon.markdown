### What it do?

My first major project, which I'm still proud of today, was when I was a teenager. My dream back then was to create a game, but at the time, you needed an engine for that. So, I built one. I didn't end up making a full game with it, just some demos, of course. With this engine, you could script a game using the Lua language, it supported loading assets directly from compressed files on-the-fly, joystick support, and other features.
