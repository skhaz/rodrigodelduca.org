### Beginning

![I riding a horse](/assets/images/horse.jpg)

Hacker to the bone. I learned electronics before I could read, and by the age of 8, I was already programming in LOGO and BASIC.

I felt that I wanted that for the rest of my life and loved it from the bottom of my heart.

As a hardcore programmer, I got into low-level programming as a teenager and even built my own 2D engine during that time.

Unix philosophy, DRY, and KISS run in my veins. I solve complex problems with simple solutions.

Simplicity here doesn’t mean technical deficiency. On the contrary — it requires exceptional skill to hide complexity behind elegant and straightforward solutions.

Over the years, I’ve gained experience in embedded systems, mobile, game development, backend, frontend, and DevOps. I’ve always been a jack-of-all-trades, consistently supporting those around me—whether through technical help or by driving engagement and personal growth.

I write code that runs on microcontrollers, mobile devices, desktops, the cloud, or directly on bare metal.

I have over 20 years of experience with C, C++, and Python, and I’m also fluent in Go, TypeScript, and other languages.

I recently embraced the world of AI/ML, becoming proficient in LLMs and RAG.
